# Mental Wellness Copilot for Students
This project is a private, RAG-based assistant designed to provide students with support by leveraging evidence-based mental health resources.
The assistant combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with carefully designed prompt engineering to deliver safe, reliable, and context-aware responses.
It uses **Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus** as the language model, combined with **Nomic Embed Text v1.5** for efficient semantic search and retrieval.

The project was developed collaboratively by a team of four students.
My main contributions were:
- Implementing the RAG
- Designing and optimizing the prompt templates for accurate and sensitive responses.

Throughout the development of this project, we also used AI-based assistance (e.g., ChatGPT) for guidance and idea refinement.
